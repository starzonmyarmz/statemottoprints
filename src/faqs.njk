  <h4>When will I receive my order?</h4>
  <p>All Products are made to order, We typically ask to allow 2 - 5 business days to fulfill shipment. However, due to supply disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic we ask that you give us a little extra time to fulfill orders. At this time, tee shirts can take up to 6 weeks to fulfill while prints are fulfilled in about 10 days. We appreciate your understanding!</p>
